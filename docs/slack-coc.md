Slack Code of Conduct
===========================

Welcome
--------

The current admins are:
* JDsnyke

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Confidentiality
----------------

**Please keep what's said in psxcheatlist confidential**. Don't repeat or quote things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s). When quoting (with consent), please be careful not to reveal the existence of psxcheatlist. Rather, you can refer to the quote as something that was said "in chat" or while you were talking to the quoted member.

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Logs and Records
-----------------

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Message Retention
------------------

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of psxcheatlist. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

Harassment
-----------

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting
---------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Consequences
------------

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
